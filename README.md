Design an application that adds gamification by choosing retailers meeting certain criteria weighted based on the purchasing ability of retailers in a random manner.

### Tools

- **Data** - Azure SQL
- **Logic** - Python
- **UI Elements** - Jupyter IPY widgets
- **Standalone app** - Voila

### Steps

1. The required criteria to be met is applied on data (previous day orders is considered as purchasing ability) through query in SQL.
  
2. The logic of choosing random retailers meeting certain criteria weighted based on the purchasing ability of retailers from the data is programmed in Python.
  
3. Jupyter widgets are added to the jupyter notebook as user interface elements.
